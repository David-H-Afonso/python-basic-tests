<h1 align="center">🐍 Python Basic Tests 👨🏻‍💻</h1>
<p>I'm learning Python. So I wanted to try some things, like the use of loops, conditionals, functions... etc. I've made 3 little projects to test them.</p>

<h3>👩🏻‍✈️ Password Generator - passwordGenerator.py</h3>
<li>You can type the length that you want for you password and easily generate a new super-secret one!</li>

<h3>🔮 Guess the number - guessTheNumber.py</h3>
<li>An easy game where the console is going to think a number and you need to guess it! It will tell you if you have typed a lower or higher number :)</li>

<h3>💱 Coin Exchange - coinExchange.py</h3>
<li>Right now, I've only add from dollars to euros, pesos argentinos and pesos colombianos, but add new ones is pretty simple. Type the ammount of dollars that you want to exchange and the currency, and voilá!</li>

<h3>➗ Is it prime? - primeNumber.py</h3>
<li>Type a number and it will calculate if it's prime or not</li>

<h3>Main technologies used 👷🏻‍♂️</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🐍 Python</li>
</ul>
